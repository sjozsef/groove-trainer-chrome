# Groove Trainer for Chrome

This is a Chrome extension that helps you train your inner groove.

When you activate the extension, it will randomly mute or unmute your tabs. Your task is to tap the beat on a table or play an instrument so that you don't lose time even when the music is muted.

## How to use

2. Activate the extension on a tab (e.g., YouTube).
3. Use accurately recorded music.
4. Start with easy settings and basic music with a stable 4/4 time signature.
