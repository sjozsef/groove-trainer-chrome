# Groove Trainer for Chrome

This is a Chrome extension that helps you train your inner groove.

## How it works

When you activate the extension, it will randomly mute or unmute your tabs. Your task is to tap the beat on a table or play an instrument so that you don't lose time even when the music is muted.

## How to use
1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Activate the extension on a tab (e.g., YouTube).
3. Use accurately recorded music.
4. Start with easy settings and basic music with a stable 4/4 time signature.

## Options

You can configure the minimum and maximum duration for both muted and unmuted periods. Right-click the extension icon and select "Options" to access the settings page.

The available settings are:
- **Unmuted Time Min/Max (s):** The range of time a tab will stay unmuted.
- **Muted Time Min/Max (s):** The range of time a tab will be muted.

The extension will pick a random duration within these ranges for each cycle.

## Development

To set up a development environment for this extension:
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable "Developer mode".
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project directory.

Any changes to the code will require you to reload the extension from the `chrome://extensions` page.
